Jason Hall is a 48-year-old network engineer who enjoys programming, building things, and whiskey.  He is generous and giving, but also likes his alone time to think about future plans.

He is a technology Jedi who looks for new things to learn.  He follows his late fathers montra of "It's better to be a jack of all trades than a master of one."

He grew up middle class and worked on his grandfathers farm as a teen. He loves a good walk in the woods and to get his hands dirty growing a garden in the spring because of this.
